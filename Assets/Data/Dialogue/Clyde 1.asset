  _dialogue:
  - Hey, watch where you're going! I know you're after my liver! I can just feel
    it in my bones... or rather, my liver.
  - It's like every time someone walks by, I can hear my liver screaming "Nooo, don't
    take me!"
  - I even tried putting a lock on my chest, just in case.
  - You never know what kind of liver thieves are out there these days...
